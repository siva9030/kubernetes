# Step 1. Setup an NFS server (sample for CentOS)
# First thing you will need, of course, is to have an NFS server. This can be easily achieved with some easy steps:

# Install nfs package: yum install -y nfs-utils
# Enable and start nfs service and rpcbind:
systemctl enable rpcbind
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl start rpcbind
systemctl start nfs-server
# Create the directory that will be shared by NFS, and change the permissions:
mkdir /var/nfsshare
chmod -R 755 /nfsshare-client-provisioner
chown nfsnobody:nfsnobody /nfsshare-client-provisioner

# Share the NFS directory over the network, creating the /etc/exports file:
vi /etc/exports
/var/nfsshare * (rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
# Restart the nfs service to apply the content:
systemctl restart nfs-server
